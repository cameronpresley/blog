## About Me

I've been a software engineer for over a decade and in leadership for over five years. I pride myself on helping the team succeed while maintaining my technical aptitude, as I don't believe you can be a technical leader without the ability to work with your team.

One of my greatest strengths is that I can explain anything to anyone, tailoring my message to be effective with my audience. With this ability, I'm a natural coach and have grown many engineers from intern->associate->mid->senior.

Another strength is that I excel at looking at a process, understanding the goal, and then fine-tuning to remove friction. This can be how a team approaches work, the development lifecycle, or how we interact with clients. Because of this strength, I can level up a group quickly because I can amplify our strengths and make the weaknesses a non-issue.

I enjoy learning new technology and have a track record of picking up new technologies on the fly to accomplish new tasks.

## Experience

### Lean TECHniques
#### Professional Software Consultant (Aug 2023 - May 2025)

As a Software Consultant, my engagements followed two patterns. The more common engagement is what we call the embedded "player-coach," where I would be embedded into a feature delivery team to coach/mentor engineers while also delivering functionality. The other type of engagement is leadership coaching. I would work with a Team Lead or Engineering Manager to help streamline processes or provide guidance on navigating leadership topics like performance management, career progression, adopting an experimental mindset, and team process.

Recent client accomplishments include:

- Developed and taught a custom training program for TypeScript and Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing on building distributed systems leveraging tools like SNS, SQS, Lambda, Fargate, EventBridge, and DyanmoDB, all of which were managed by using the CDK for deployments.
- Designed, Implemented, and Deployed a custom solution solution to help combine Dynatrace alerts with Microsoft Teams to notify on-call when an issue was detected
- Created multiple PowerAutomate flows to automate support requests
- Worked with Team Leader, Product Owner, and Delivery Manager to overhaul the work breakdown process to ensure that the team knows the "why" behind the work and what "done" looks like:

Recent company accomplishments include:

- Developed and led a mentorship program for interns, leading to a faster onboarding experience.
- Key contributor to a client account team (client was high 7 figure spend) to manage relationships and to find additional opportunities for Lean TECHniques
- Mentored and coached multiple associate and mid-level consultants to their next career progression
- Presented multiple internal trainings on topics like post-mortems and functional programming.
