# Leadership Playbook - Leading Through Change

There are few fundamental truths in life, one of which is that the only thing that is consistent is change. Whether that's through a re-organization, someone leaving the team, or the start of new initiative, we know that what happens today is different than yesterday and as a leader, the team is looking to you to figure out how to navigate these changes.

In this post, I'm going to walk you through some tips and tricks to leading the team through change.

## Explain the Reasoning

A common mistake I see leaders make is that they'll introduce a change, but never talk about the _why_ the change is happening. Let's take a look at a hypothetical situation where you're introducing the team to pull request templates.

> Hey team! Starting next sprint, we're going to starting using this new PR template. You can find it ....

On one hand, the message is clear on the what's changing (using new PR template) and what's changing, it completely skipped the why. When we don't include the why, we catch people off-guard because they may not immediately understand the problem that the change is suppossed to solve.

When we put people in an information vacuum, they draw their own conclusions, which can give the wrong impression behind the change.

Let's revisit the same scenario, but include the "why" this time.

> Hey team! During our last retro, it was brought up that our pull requests descriptions aren't consistent, which makes reviewing them more difficult. To help build consistency, we're going to start using pull request templates. You can find it ....

By making this small change, we can squash misinformation and potential rumor mills because we're clear on the reasoning.

Which is a great segue to...

## Be Transparent With the Team

When explaining the reason, don't lie or sugar coat the reasoning, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable. Your team is smart and they're going to know if you're lying to them.

A hot topic nowadays are company's Return to Office (RTO) plans, with a common reason being "need more in-person collaboration". Even though this provides a "why", it's not backed by metrics or anything measurable. In addition, in-person doesn't necessarily mean more collaboration.

A better approach is to use employee engagement surveys or customer satisfaction surveys to measure if the team/company is being effective. If you can't use these metrics (or other relevant metrics), then why are you introducing this change?

Going back to our hypothetical RTO, let's say that the reason for us going back to the office is that we're a start-up where our investors have already paid for our space. To them, having people in the space helps them feel better that they're money is well spent (in addition, they could be getting a tax break for having people on-site).

This is what you should be telling your team. They may not like the reason and they might disagree, but they know the why and then they can make their own decisions. Long story short, you're giving them the autonomy to make their own decisions because they have all the information.

## Repetition and Change Acceptance Model

Humans don't have perfect memory, right? So why would we expect that once we introduce a change then that's the last time we need to talk about it? Regardless of the change, don't be surprised if you need to mention it 3 or 4 times before people finally start understanding and applying the change. A [great mentor of mine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeseto/) once told me that he would tell people about the change time and time again until it stuck. During this time, he would show patience, repeat the messaging, and answer questions.

When we hear of change, we're processing the message and the immediate impacts. For some people, they'll have questions immediately, for others, they'll need to time stew on it. Because of this, be available to answer questions as they come up (even the same ones). As such, be prepared for questions during one-on-ones, after meetings, or whenever they come up. Acknowledge the questions and answer it. If you don't know the answer, respond that you'll find the answer and then run it down. 

Depending on the severity of the change, your team members may be going through the

## Leading Through Change When You Don't Agree With It

- Why don't you agree with it? (Assuming it's not unethical/illegal?)
- If there are upsides, talk about them, but don't wave off the downsides
- What are you (and other leaders) doing to make sure the negatives don't outweigh the positives?





If you've been a leader for a bit, you may have already navigated some big challenges like the pandemic and layoffs. If you're new 
As a leader, I've had to introduce changes to the team both positive and challenging and I've learned a few lessons on what not to do.
