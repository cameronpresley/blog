# Courses

As someone who enjoys leveling up others, I have published courses on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) to help engineers improve by learning concepts like functional programming.

### Navigating Mars Using TypeScript and Functional Programming

In this course, I walk you through solving the Mars Rover kata by using functional programming concepts like immutability, functions, and composition.

Designed for those who are new to functional programming concepts, but are familiar with TypeScript, you'll leave the course having the tools needed to start writing your own programs.

Interested? You can find the course [here on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/navigating-mars-using-ts-and-fp/?referralCode=134CA0E5EF78A43698B3).

### Learn Functional TypeScript by Building Blackjack

In this course, I walk you through implementing your own version of Blackjack using functional proramming with TypeScript. We'll cover topics like:

- How to build better domain models using concepts like Sum and Product types
- How to build repeatable and testable business rules leveraging pure functions
- How to handle when operations can fail using the Maybe pattern
- How to manage state when it's always changing

Interested? You can [send an email](mailto:Cameron@TheSoftwareMentor.com?subject=Interested%20In%20Functional%20Blackjack%20Course) to be alerted when the course goes alive (tentatively Summer 2025)
