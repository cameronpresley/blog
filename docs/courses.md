# Courses

As someone who enjoys leveling up others, I have published courses on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) to help engineers improve by learning concepts like functional programming.

### Navigating Mars Using TypeScript and Functional Programming

In this course, I walk you through solving the Mars Rover kata by using functional programming concepts like immutability, functions, and composition.

Designed for those who are new to functional programming concepts, but are familiar with TypeScript, you'll leave the course having the tools needed to start writing your own programs.
