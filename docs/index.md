## Hello!

My name is Cameron Presley, and welcome to my blog, The Software Mentor!

This is where I write about software, leadership, and other lessons learned over my career. There are plenty of blogs out there already speaking about these topics, however, I've found that there's power in seeing how others approach problems.

My hope is that you'll find a different perspective, learn a new way to think about things, and in turn level up.
